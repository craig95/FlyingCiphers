# FlyingCiphers

Write a program that would be able to
decipher any Ceasar ciphertext with an
alphabet of maximum 62 characters

Test your program with the following
message:
>2XQM5QN7A10QYUXXU104M0P59146T
1R5TM4Q5M0PNQOM4QR7X01661NQ5
QQ0NA6TQM7564MXUM0S18Q40YQ06
M0P2XQM5QNQ8USUXM06

All spaces were removed from the message.
Your program need not have the intelligence
to tell what the correct message is. If it can do
that, however, 20% bonus will be awarded.
